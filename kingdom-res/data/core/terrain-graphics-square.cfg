# The following flags are defined to have a meaning
#
# * base : the corresponding tile has already graphics for the terrain
# base. No other one should be added.
# * transition-$direction : the corresponding tile already has the transition
# in the given direction (or should not have one). No other one should be
# added.
#
# when adding new probabilities update the commented line
# the proper way to calculate the propabilities is described here

# NOTE the terrain _off^_usr gets its definition from the code since it's
# themable
